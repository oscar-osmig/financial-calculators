************************************************************************************************************************

1 Ordinary Annuity Formula: Used to calculate monthly payments:
       M = P [ (r(1+r)^n) / ((1+r)^n - 1) ]
       Where: M = monthly payment P = present value (loan amount) r = monthly interest rate n = number of payments

2 Monthly Interest Rate: Annual interest rate divided by 12:
       r = annual interest rate / 12

3 Total Interest Paid: The sum of interest paid over the loan’s life:
       Total Interest = P * r * (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1)

                                                         EXAMPLE

Suppose you want to calculate the monthly payment for a $450,000 loan with a 4.0% annual interest rate and a 15-year term.

Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: 4.0% / 12 = 0.003333 (monthly rate)
Calculate the number of payments: 15 years * 12 months/year = 180 payments
Use the ordinary annuity formula:
M = $450,000 [ (0.003333(1+0.003333)^180) / ((1+0.003333)^180 - 1) ] ≈ $3,328.60

This calculation yields a monthly payment of approximately $3,328.60.
